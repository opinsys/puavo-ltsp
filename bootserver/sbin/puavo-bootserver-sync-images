#
# This script manages system images on a bootserver for use with thinclients,
# fatclients, and for locally installed clients such as laptops that can
# download images/diffs for their use.
#
# Managed images and diffs are images/diffs downloaded by this script.
# Their paths are stored in /var/lib/puavo/images.json.  This script may
# delete the images/diffs specified there once those are no longer needed.
#
# Unmanaged images/diffs are other images and diffs in download paths
# ("/opt/ltsp/images" and "/opt/ltsp/images/rdiffs" by default).
#
# By default the script handles only the managed images and unmanaged images
# are left untouched.  The script can be asked to delete unmanaged images with
# two command line options: "--delete-unmanaged-interactively" asks for each
# unmanaged image/diff if it can be deleted, and "--force-delete-unmanaged"
# removes those unconditionally after images/diffs are synced.
# Note that these options are not needed to delete unused _managed_ images,
# which happens automatically.
#
# Steps done by the script:
#
# 1. Check image series source URLs from Puavo (or given as --url parameter)
# 2. Load image series description JSON files from specified URLs
#    (or from paths given by --file parameter)
# 3. Determine wanted full images and start syncing them one by one,
#    going from oldest to newest
#      3.1 For each image, check if there is an older image available and
#          a diff which can be used to create the target image from
#          the old one: use those to create the target image
# 3. Download diffs needed by locally installed client devices
#    (laptops and such)
# 4. Delete old unused managed images and diffs
# 5. If asked with ----force-delete-unmanaged, delete unmanaged images/diffs

  Image sync tool for bootservers to download client images from image server.
  This tool touches only files that have .img or .rdiff ending.

  Image series is a collection of images that are based on same underlying
  system.  They are versioned and updates from older to newer versions are
  supported.

  Images are downloaded from an image server.  The series is defined by a JSON
  file that contains information about images and diffs.  The image source
  URL is defined in bootserver settings in Puavo and the script queries the
  information from puavo-rest by default.  Series information is parsed from
  the JSON files and by default the following images and diffs are downloaded:

  * Two newest images from each series
  * Diffs from 2nd and 3rd newest image in the series
  * All images used by netboot devices
  * All preferred images used by non-netboot devices
  * All diffs needed by non-netboot devices to update from the current image
    to preferred images

  All files have checksums that are checked before they are actually used.

  An example that defines two images and a diff between them:
